ANS-1:
Implicit vs. Explicit Animations

Implicit: Animations triggered automatically by changes (e.g., color, size) using widgets like Animated Container, Animated Opacity. 

Explicit: Controlled manually using Animation Controller and Tween for custom, fine-tuned animations.                               


ANS-2:
Purpose of AnimationController and its Usage

Animation Controller is used in explicit animations to control:
Start, stop, reverse, and repeat of an animation.

Requires:
 A `TickerProvider` (usually via `SingleTickerProviderStateMixin`).
 Set `duration`, define `Tween`, and call `controller.forward()` or `reverse()`.

_animationController = AnimationController(
  vsync: this,
  duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
);


ANS-3:
What is a Hero Animation in Flutter?

Hero animation creates a smooth transition of a widget (like an image) between two screens.
Matches Hero tags across screens to animate seamlessly.
Example: Image on List Page zooms into Detail Page using Hero(tag: 'img1', child: Image(...)).
