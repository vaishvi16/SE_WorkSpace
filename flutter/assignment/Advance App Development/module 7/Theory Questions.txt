ANS-1:
What is a RESTful API and its importance in mobile apps?

A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is a way for apps to communicate with servers using standard HTTP methods. It sends/receives data (often in JSON format) between a client (like a mobile app) and a backend.

Importance:
  Enables mobile apps to fetch dynamic content (like user data, weather, products).
  Ensures real-time updates and cloud integration.
  Promotes scalability and code separation (frontend/backend).


ANS-2:
How is JSON parsed and used in Flutter?

JSON is a lightweight format for sending structured data.
Use jsonDecode(response.body) to convert JSON string into a Dart Map or List.
Create model classes to map and access this data.

Example:

  dart
  final data = jsonDecode(response.body);
  String name = data['user']['name'];
